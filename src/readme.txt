2.	List five significant features of React
i. <b>Virtual Dom</b>: React uses a Virtual DOM -- Document Objet Model to efficient update the user Interface.

ii. Component Based Architecture: React is a component based library this means that it allows you to create reusable
and independent pieces of UI called component,which helps to break down application into smaller,more manageable 
pieces ,therby making it easier to maintain

iii. <b>JSX</b>: React uses JSX (JavaScript XML) to write HTML-like syntax in JavaScript. This allows you to write HTML-like code in your 
JavaScript files, which makes it easier to create UI components and eliminates the need for a separate templating language.

iv. <b>Unidirectional Data Flow</b>: React follows a unidirectional data flow, which means that data flows only
 in one direction - from the parent component to the child component. This makes it easier to understand how data is passed around
 in your application and helps to prevent unexpected side effects.

v.<b>Reusable Component</b>: React components are reusable, which means that you can use the same component in multiple places throughout your application. This saves time and reduces the amount of code you need to write. Additionally, you can easily share your components with others,
 or even use components created by others in your own application.

 3.	List five major advantages of React

 i. Virtual Dom: React uses a virtual DOM to represent the user interface, which allows 
 it to update only the parts of the UI that have changed, rather than having to re-render the entire page.
  This makes React applications faster and more efficient.

ii Component Based Architecture: React is based on component based Architecture which makses it easie to maintain
and manage large based architectures.

iii. Declarative Programming Model: React uses a Declarative Programming model which means that the developers what
they want the UI to look like and React take care of the How,, thereby making it easier to write and maintain code anf reduces the 
risk of Bugs

iv. Large Community Ecosysytem:React has a large and active community of developers, which means that there are many resources and libraries available to help developers 
build React applications. This makes it easier to get started with React, and to find help and support when needed.

v. Cross Platform Compatibility: React can be used to build applications for a variety of platforms, including web, mobile, and desktop. This makes it a versatile tool for building applications that can run on a wide range of devices and operating systems.
